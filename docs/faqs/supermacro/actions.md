<!-- NOTE: To you, the Contributor!
    Ironically, the double-bracket syntax used in SuperMacro conflicts with a special Marco syntax we can use here.
    See custom-functions.md in the *root* of the repository for the workaround

# SuperMacro - Available actions 
The plugin includes six actions. Below you will find a more in depth description of each action.

## Super Macro
This is the basic implementation. Create a macro and run it on keypress. Examples can be seen in the [Usage Examples](./examples.md) section.

## Super Macro Toggle
Toggle between two different macros on the same key.

## Sticky Super Macro
Click once to enable, the macro will run again and again until either the button is pressed again OR until the [loop](./loops.md) ends.

## Keystroke PTT
This action limits the action to either one command (such as `{{ "{{ctrl}{c}}" }}`) or one character. The command will be run again and again as long as you continue to press the key.

## Sticky Keystroke
This action limits the action to either one command (such as `{{ "{{ctrl}{c}}" }}`) or one character. The command will be run again and again until the button is pressed again OR until the [loop](./loops.md) ends.

## Mouse Location
!!! info "Long pressing button"

    **Note:** Long pressing the button on the Stream Deck will copy the current X,Y shown on the key to your Clipboard.
Shows you the current position of your mouse cursor. You can use it to determine where you want SuperMacro to move your mouse (Using the `{{ "{{MOUSEXY}}" }}` [mouse command](./commands.md)).
